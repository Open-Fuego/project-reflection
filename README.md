# Project Reflection

Hello digital composer! Welcome to my Project Reflection web design tool, powered by Stasis Theory. I'm glad you found it--we're going to adapt a 2,000-year-old formula to help you pitch an idea, explaining who you are and what you want, why it's important, and what it will do for your audience. I use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about rhetoric, and a little bit about computer science. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web document that helps you process your experience, learn a little bit about coding, and strategically package the work you have accomplished in your project/internship/teaching assistantship. 

To get started, simply open the index.html file using a code editor (brackets.io / atom.io, etc.). All of the instructions for building/replacing content are embedded in the code. 

Head to [Pitt Fuego](http://pitt.edu/~sjq4/PittFuego/#Introductions) to see all of our other cool coding projects.
